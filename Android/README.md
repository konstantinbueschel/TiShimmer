TiAlternativeProgressBar
========================

### [Download][rls] [Example][exm]

[rls]: https://github.com/smclab/TiAlternativeProgressBar/releases
[exm]: https://github.com/smclab/TiAlternativeProgressBar/tree/master/example

Drop-in replacement for `Ti.UI.ProgressBar`, but with support for **indeterminate mode** and a
**secondary progress**. (Android only)

Usage
-----

If you want to understand what `secondary` actually means or if you want to see it in action,
in `example/app.js` youâ€™ll find a complete example. The following one only acts as a reference.

```js
var AlternateProgressBar = require('it.smc.alternativeprogressbar');

var progressbar = AlternateProgressBar.createProgressBar({
    min: 0,
    max: 100,
    value: 42,
    secondary: 49,
    indeterminate: true // set to false (default) to show an actual progress
});
```
